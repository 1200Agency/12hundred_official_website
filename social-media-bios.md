1200 Agency | Full-Stack Growth Engineering

We're the agency your developer friends would build.

Most agencies talk about "digital transformation" but can't code their way out of a paper bag. We're different. We're developers who mastered growth—not marketers who learned to code.

What we do:
→ Full-stack web development (actually fast, actually optimized)
→ Sales funnels that convert (engineered, not just designed)
→ Brand identity that doesn't suck
→ Copy that makes people click "buy"
→ Automation that actually works

Why we're different:
✓ We write production code, not just mockups
✓ We optimize for Core Web Vitals, not just aesthetics
✓ We understand APIs, webhooks, and actual integrations
✓ We speak developer and business fluently

Our approach: Tech-first, results-obsessed, BS-free.

If you're tired of agencies that promise the moon but deliver PowerPoints, let's talk.

## 💬 Quick Social Posts (Ready to Use)

### Post 1: Introduction
```
We're the agency your developer friends would build.

Most agencies talk about "digital transformation" but can't code their way out of a paper bag.

We're different. We're developers who mastered growth.

Translation: We actually know what an API is. 💻

### Post 2: Differentiation
```
Traditional agencies: "We'll design you a beautiful website!"

Us: "Cool, but will it load in under 2 seconds? Does it pass Core Web Vitals? Can it handle 10k concurrent users?"

There's a difference between pretty and performant.

We build both. 🚀

#WebPerformance #WebDev
```

### Post 3: Problem/Solution
```
You: "Can you integrate with our CRM?"
Most agencies: "We'll need to hire a developer for that"
Us: "Which CRM? We'll have it done by Tuesday"

Developer-first means we don't outsource the technical stuff.

We ARE the technical stuff. 💪

#TechAgency #Developers

### Post 4: Value Prop
```
What we do:
→ Build websites so fast your users think their WiFi upgraded
→ Create funnels that actually convert (not just look pretty)
→ Write copy that makes people click "buy"
→ Automate the boring stuff

What we don't do:
→ Use buzzwords
→ Overpromise
→ Pretend we know things we don't

Simple. 🎯

```

### Post 5: Personality
```
Client: "Can you make it pop more?"
Other agencies: *adds drop shadow*
Us: "Define 'pop.' Are we talking contrast ratio, visual hierarchy, or just vibes?"

We speak both business and developer.
It's a superpower. ⚡
